# **Graph**

- **Graph is a collection of nodes where each node might or might not point to other nodes.**
- **Nodes represent real life entities and are connected by edges representing relationship between the nodes/entities.**

### **Applications of Graph**

1. **Google maps** 
2. **Splitwise** 

## G=(V,E)

Graph is an ordered pair of set V and set E  representing vertices and edges 

## Types of graphs

Parameter → direction 

## Undirected graph and undirected graph

## Weighted graph and unweighted graph

# Graph terminologies

### Multigraph → An undirected graph in which multiple edges are allowed between 2 nodes (Loops exist)

### Simple Graph → An undirected graph in which both multiple edges and loops are not allowed (No loops)
