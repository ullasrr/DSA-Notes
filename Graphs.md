# **Graph Part -1**

- **Graph is a collection of nodes where each node might or might not point to other nodes.**
- **Nodes represent real life entities and are connected by edges representing relationship between the nodes/entities.**

### **Applications of Graph**

1. **Google maps** 
2. **Split wise**    

## G=(V,E)

Graph is an ordered pair of set V and set E  representing vertices and edges 

## Types of graphs

Parameter → direction 

## Undirected graph and undirected graph

## Weighted graph and unweighted graph

# Graph terminologies

### Multigraph → An undirected graph in which multiple edges are allowed between 2 nodes (Loops exist)

### Simple Graph → An undirected graph in which both multiple edges and loops are not allowed (No loops)

### Complete Graph → A complete graph is the one in which every node is directly connected to the every other node

### Connected graph → In this graph we have  a direct or indirect path for every possible pair of vertex

### What is a Path?

→ Path is a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a sequence

### What is a Cycle?

→ A cycle is also a graph whose vertices can be arranged in cyclic sequence

### DAG(direct acyclic graph)

### Degree → Degree of a vertex in a graph is the total no of edges incident to it or away from it

### Indegree → Total number of incoming edges

### Outdegree → Total number of out going edges

### Trees → Trees are kind of a graph with no cycles, if we remove all cycles from a graph we get Trees

### → If we remove an edge from a tree, it no more remains connected & should be called a forest
